Dear Journal,

Today was a really exciting day! I learned how to read files using Python, which opens up so many possibilities for working with data.

Here are a few things I learned:
- How to open a file using the `open()` function.
- How to read all the contents at once with `.read()`.
- How to read line-by-line with `.readlines()`.

I'm looking forward to practicing more with Python and creating more interesting projects!

Sincerely,
Your Coding Student
